InstantCar
========

InstantCar is a small web application for car rent. 


Structure
--------
1. On the main page, you can see the big picture with the main advert, a link to a catalogue with filter and block with "best" cars for sale. Each car has a base description, photo and link to the detail page.

2. On cars page, there is a catalogue of all available cars and filter with two parameters "carmaker" and "model" filtered alphabetically. Each car has its own description, photo and a link to the detail page. When you select carmaker cars automatically sort by this selection and "model" filter automatically fills with allowable models for this car brand, a catalogue automatically refreshes to show cars filtered by those parameters. If you will push the "Reset" button filter will be reset.

3. Detail page contains a full description of the car, photo gallery and button to reserve this car. You can reserve the car by pressing the button "Make reserve" and the car will be hidden from the filter and no longer available on the cars page â€“ you will obtain popup with message "Reservation successful!". If you will push the button again you will have the popup with message "Already reserved".

Look how easy it is to use:

	import project
    # Get your stuff done
    project.do_stuff()

Features
